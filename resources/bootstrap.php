/*
 * This file is used to bootstrap the app, and is required by Bones.
 * Bootstrapping is primarily done by interacting with the service container
 * by adding all the required dependencies which will be used throughout the app,
 * and defining their alias, if desired.
 *
 * The service container is available in this file as $container, which already contains
 * all the default services.
 *
 * For more information, see:
